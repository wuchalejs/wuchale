## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 0b5c207: Svelte: auto wrap variable declarations by `$derived` as needed instead of requiring it in the code
- d531bcc: Add support for multiple custom patterns to support full l10n

  For example, if you want to use [`Intl.MessageFormat`](https://formatjs.github.io/docs/intl-messageformat/) for everything it supports including plurals, you add a signature pattern for a utility function in the config:

  ```js
  // ...
  adapters: js({
    patterns: [
      {
        name: "formatMsg",
        args: ["message", "other"],
      },
    ],
  });
  //...
  ```

  Then you create your reusable utility function with that name:

  ```js
  // where you get the locale
  let locale = "en";

  export function formatMsg(msg, args) {
    return new IntlMessageFormat(msg, locale).format(args);
  }
  ```

  And use it anywhere:

  ```js
  const msg = formatMsg(
    `{numPhotos, plural,
        =0 {You have no photos.}
        =1 {You have one photo.}
        other {You have # photos.}
      }`,
    { numPhotos: 1000 }
  );
  ```

  Then wuchale will extract and transform it into:

  ```js
  const msg = formatMsg(_w_runtime_.t(0), { numPhotos: 1000 });
  ```

### Minor Changes

- fef0d11: Add the `@wc-ignore-file` comment directive

  As an alternative to ignoring a file in the `files` config value, you can now
  ignore a whole file by putting this directive at the beginning of the file,
  before any extractable messages. The advantage is that it doesn't need a
  restart of the dev server and if you rename/move the file it will always be
  ignored.

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 5ec75dc: Use component in components to preserve non string types

  This is mainly relevant to the JSX adapter, where components themselves can be
  passed around as values and props, and previously, if they are in expressions
  like this:

  ```jsx
  const msg = <b>Hello</b>;
  return <p>{msg} and welcome</p>;
  ```

  The `msg` would be converted into a string and it would become `[object Object]`.

  Now this has been fixed.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- af21188: Optional support for separate loader for SSR
- 26ce0c3: Separate reactive and plain loader functions

  This is to fix errors happening specifically with React as it doesn't allow
  using hooks inside non hooks or components. But it opens up finer
  configurations for Svelte and SolidJS as well for which the defaults have been
  adjusted as well.

  You can now export different functions from the loader files for reactive (e.g.
  using hooks) and non reactive (e.g. just simple object lookup) and tell
  `wuchale` their names using configuration options, and also adjust which one is
  used when.

  If you want to update your loader(s), you can do `npx wuchale init` and select
  another one than `existing`.

### Patch Changes

- 808aec6: Preserve using top level `$derived` strings in <script module>s and .svelte.js files for csr only apps

  The difference is that code inside those places only runs once at startup. It
  is okay in client only apps because it can be driven afterwards by state
  changes but it causes a problem in SSR where it only runs at server startup and
  should not be affected by subsequent state changes to not leak info between
  requests, causing a flicker when the specific request's locale is different
  from the one at server startup. To solve this, put translateable strings inside
  function definitions instead of `$derived` so that that function gets executed
  for each request and can get the user's locale. Client only apps are free to
  use either way.

### Minor Changes

- c79ae56: Move runtime initialization into the transformed code, framework agnostic HMR

  The `Runtime` instance is now initialized inside the transformed code and now
  loaders are required to always return a catalog module. This makes all loaders
  consistent and makes the `Runtime` an implementation detail. If your loaders
  return `new Runtime(catalog)`, you have to unwrap it and return just `catalog`
  (or `undefined` in the case of `new Runtime()`). The default loaders are
  updated to return the catalog module. If you haven't modified them and want to
  use the new ones, you can overwrite them by running `npx wuchale init` and
  selecting a loader different from `existing`.

  This also solves the problem where HMR may sometimes not work depending on the
  method of loading the catalog modules, by avoiding HMR events and the
  reactivity from the framework, and just embedding the catalog updates in the
  transformed code itself. This also makes it fast as it now doesn't have to wait
  for an event from the Vite dev server to update the state. This is only for dev
  mode so the production builds still stay lean.

  The downside of avoiding using HMR events is that it's now unable to make the
  updates from editing the PO files granular and has to do a full reload. But
  this is a reasonable tradeoff as editing PO files is not done continuously, but
  editing code is.

### Patch Changes

- 99e02be: Fix error on SvelteKit SSR load with <script module>s and .svelte.js files

  This was caused when there are <script module>s and `wuchale` would try to
  initialize the runtime instance in them from the load functions which are
  incompatible with <script module>s because they run only once in the server.
  Now it uses AsyncLocalStorage on the server and using `wrapInit` and `wrapExpr`
  to make the runtime instance computed when it is requested instead of once
  initially.

  In `wuchale.config.js`

  ```js
      main: adapter({
          runtime: {
              wrapInit: expr => `() => ${expr}`,
              wrapExpr: expr => `${expr}()`,
          }
      }),
  ```

  And we also need to load the catalogs for the server in `hooks.server.{js,ts}`

  ```js
  import type { Handle } from "@sveltejs/kit";
  import { loadCatalog, loadIDs, key } from "./locales/loader.svelte.js";
  import { runWithLocale, loadLocales } from "wuchale/load-utils/server";

  await loadLocales(key, loadIDs, loadCatalog, ["en", "es", "fr"]);

  export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
    const locale = event.url.searchParams.get("locale") ?? "en";
    return await runWithLocale(locale, async () => {
      return await resolve(event, {});
    });
  };
  ```

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ac94b4: Add importName option to adapters

  You can also specify in what name the default export of the loader files is imported.

- d131ebe: Iron out universal HMR, update loaders, organize exports, improve loading reactivity

  This change fixes every small issue with HMR, like editing a file and changing the locale,
  editing the PO file and then the loader file, etc... it should always work as expected now.

  Another thing is that most exports are now from the base `wuchale` package
  except those that may be included in the build outputs of applications which
  should be selectively loaded to improve tree shaking. Most importantly, the loading utilities are now in:

  - `wuchale/load-utils` for client loading
  - `wuchale/load-utils/server` for server loading
  - `wuchale/load-utils/pure` for side effect-free loading

  All of these are optional and if you don't use them, they will not be included in your build.

  The client utility `registerLoaders` function's optional fourth argument is now
  an object with `get` and `set` methods. This allows more control over the state
  of the catalogs for use with the reactivity patterns of any library.

- 5531f84: Add more adapter config options to control runtime

  This brings more options to configure how exactly the runtime instance is
  initialized and used. You can now choose where to initialize it (top level or
  only inside function definitions with certain names), and you can also wrap the
  initialization expression so that you can, for example, put it inside something
  else other than `$derived` in svelte.

### Patch Changes

- a6746e0: Fix and improve default loaders and loader selection

  The default suggested loader for the svelte adapter was not reactive to locale changes, now fixed.
  Moreover, the default loader selection experience has been improved by removing unnecessary
  interations and removing irrelevant choices. For example, there is no need to suggest importing
  from a file proxy instead of a virtual module while using the svelte adapter, because vite will be
  there anyway because of svelte.

  import { key } from "virtual:wuchale/proxy";
  ```
