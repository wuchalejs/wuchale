Add support for translating URL paths!

This is the biggest addition on this release. Internationalizing URL paths is now possible,
with the same conveniences of no/minimal code changes, while respecting the fact that URLs
are to be handled carefully.

There are two parts to this:

- Translation: e.g. `/about` to `/uber-uns`
- Localization: e.g. `/about` to `/en/about`

Full guide coming soon in the docs!
